# Mario-Demo
A short demo for Mario game, coded in Jack.

This game was created as an asignment for the course "From Nand to Tetris".

In order to play this game you will need: 
1. A VMEmulator, such as the one included in the free software suit, downloadable from here: https://www.nand2tetris.org/software
2. The .vm files only (which are the compiled .jack files).

If you're going through the course as well, please feel free to use the source code for inspiration (Don't copy!).
